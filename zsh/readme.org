#+STARTUP: overview

* Ninrod's zsh configuration
- I don't use any plugin manager. just some functions to source plugins that live under ~/.dotfiles/deps.
- I use a separate simple script to git clone the plugins myself (install.zsh)
- zshrc.zsh is the main file and it's split up into more manageable pieces
